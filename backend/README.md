The overall goal of this app is for it to be able to apply to jobs (say on linkedin for a start) that match the uploaded resume automatically. I want create an LLM that will take and analyze the resume, check each job postings and submit an application to those (maybe top 10 first start, there should be a way to select more on the webpage for subscribed users) that match the skills in the resume. The llm can be built using langgraph and I want it to support both enterprise LLM api calls from OpenAI and others, as well as local LLM deployed via ollama.
